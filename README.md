# Dinic-s-Algorithm
Project 5 Dinic's Algorithm
In this project, there are a source and sink. First, the source is connected to six nodes. Those six nodes are connected to other nodes. Eventually all connections lead to the sink. In the input file, first line contains number of nodes except source, sink and first six nodes. Following line contains capacities of the edges connecting source to the first six nodes. Then nodes written down with their directed connections and their connections' weigths. The output file contains the max flow as first line. Then it contains the edges of the min cut.
The code can be run on the terminal like "project5.java input file output file"
